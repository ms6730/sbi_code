# Parameter Inference

**Parameter inference** refers to the process of estimating the values of parameters in a statistical or mathematical model based on observed data. These parameters are typically unknown quantities that define the underlying behavior of the model. The goal of parameter inference is to draw conclusions about these parameters and assess how well they explain the observed data.

## Key Concepts in Parameter Inference

1. **Model**:  
   A mathematical representation of the system being studied. It includes parameters that are to be inferred.  
   - **Example**: In a linear regression model \( y = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ x + $\epsilon$ \), \($\beta_0\$) and \($\beta_1\$) are parameters.

2. **Data**:  
   Observed measurements or outcomes used to estimate the parameters.

3. **Parameter Estimation**:  
   The process of finding the most likely or best-fitting values of the parameters.  
   - Common methods include:  
     - **Bayesian Inference**: Using prior distributions and updating beliefs based on observed data to estimate parameters.

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**:  
   Assessing the confidence or uncertainty in the inferred parameters, often expressed as posterior distributions (in Bayesian methods).   
   In Bayesian inference, uncertainty is expressed through a **posterior distribution**, which represents the probability of different parameter values given the observed data and prior beliefs.  

## Amortized Methods in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

The idea behind **amortized methods** is to train a universal model (a posterior estimator) that can quickly predict the posterior distribution for different observations without needing retraining. Letâ€™s break this down:

### How It Happens: The Process

#### 1. Training Phase
- Amortized methods start by training a model (e.g., a neural network) on a **large number of simulations**.
- The model learns a mapping from **observations** (data) to **posterior distributions**.

**Example:**
- Simulate data $\(x\)$ using a known set of parameters $\(\theta\)$ from your simulator.
- The model is trained to predict (P($\theta$ $\mid x$)\), the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data.

---

#### 2. Reuse Across Observations
- Once trained, the model can infer the posterior distribution for **new observations** without additional training.
- The model generalizes across similar datasets because it has learned the relationship between data $\(x\)$ and parameters ($\theta\$).

---

#### 3. Efficiency Gains
- Instead of retraining the posterior estimator for every new dataset or observation, you **reuse the same trained model**.
- This is much faster and computationally cheaper, especially when you have many observations to analyze.

---

### Why This Works

#### Generalization
- The model learns **general patterns** from the training data that apply to a wide range of possible observations.

#### Neural Networks (or Other Flexible Models)
- Neural networks are capable of approximating **complex mappings** from data to posteriors, allowing them to adapt to varying observations.

---

#### Advantages

1. **Speed**: Once trained, the model can infer posteriors for new observations almost instantaneously.
2. **Reusability**: The same model works for any observation within the same simulation context.
3. **Scalability**: Perfect for large-scale problems where multiple datasets or observations need to be analyzed.


## Sequential Methods in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

**Sequential methods** focus on improving efficiency by iteratively refining the posterior distribution based on new simulations. Unlike amortized methods, which estimate the posterior for all observations at once, sequential methods are tailored for **individual observations**. They carefully choose which simulations to run in order to extract the most information.

## How It Happens: The Process

### 1. Start with a Prior
- Begin with a **prior distribution** for the parameters ($\theta\$), which represents your initial belief about the parameter values before observing any data.
- **Example:** You might start with a uniform prior over a wide range of possible parameter values.

### 2. Simulate Data
- Use your **simulator** to generate data \$(x\$) for different parameter values sampled from the prior.

### 3. Update the Posterior
- Based on how well the simulated data matches the observed data $\(x_{\text{obs}}\$), update the posterior distribution P($\theta$ $\mid x$)\.
- **Bayesian Updating:** The new posterior reflects which parameter values are more or less likely given the observed data.

### 4. Refine Parameter Search
- The algorithm identifies which parts of the parameter space are still uncertain or poorly explored.
- It focuses simulations in these regions to **improve the posterior estimate efficiently**.

### 5. Repeat the Process
- The prior is updated to the **refined posterior**, and new simulations are run in the most informative regions of the parameter space.
- This iterative process continues until:
  - The posterior distribution **converges**, or
  - The desired level of accuracy is achieved.

# Parameter Inference

**Parameter inference** refers to the process of estimating the values of parameters in a statistical or mathematical model based on observed data. These parameters are typically unknown quantities that define the underlying behavior of the model. The goal of parameter inference is to draw conclusions about these parameters and assess how well they explain the observed data.

## Key Concepts in Parameter Inference

1. **Model**:  
   A mathematical representation of the system being studied. It includes parameters that are to be inferred.  
   - **Example**: In a linear regression model \( y = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ x + $\epsilon$ \), \($\beta_0\$) and \($\beta_1\$) are parameters.

2. **Data**:  
   Observed measurements or outcomes used to estimate the parameters.

3. **Parameter Estimation**:  
   The process of finding the most likely or best-fitting values of the parameters.  
   - Common methods include:  
     - **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Maximizing the likelihood that the observed data occurred given the parameters.
     - **Bayesian Inference**: Using prior distributions and updating beliefs based on observed data to estimate parameters.

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**:  
   Assessing the confidence or uncertainty in the inferred parameters, often expressed as confidence intervals or posterior distributions (in Bayesian methods).

5. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   In some cases, parameter inference involves testing whether certain values of parameters are plausible or statistically significant.

# Parameter Inference

**Parameter inference** refers to the process of estimating the values of parameters in a statistical or mathematical model based on observed data. These parameters are typically unknown quantities that define the underlying behavior of the model. The goal of parameter inference is to draw conclusions about these parameters and assess how well they explain the observed data.

## Key Concepts in Parameter Inference

1. **Model**:  
   A mathematical representation of the system being studied. It includes parameters that are to be inferred.  
   - **Example**: In a linear regression model \( y = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ x + $\epsilon$ \), \($\beta_0\$) and \($\beta_1\$) are parameters.

2. **Data**:  
   Observed measurements or outcomes used to estimate the parameters.

3. **Parameter Estimation**:  
   The process of finding the most likely or best-fitting values of the parameters.  
   - Common methods include:  
     - **Bayesian Inference**: Using prior distributions and updating beliefs based on observed data to estimate parameters.

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**:  
   Assessing the confidence or uncertainty in the inferred parameters, often expressed as posterior distributions (in Bayesian methods).   
   In Bayesian inference, uncertainty is expressed through a **posterior distribution**, which represents the probability of different parameter values given the observed data and prior beliefs.  

## Amortized Methods in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

The idea behind **amortized methods** is to train a universal model (a posterior estimator) that can quickly predict the posterior distribution for different observations without needing retraining. Let’s break this down:

### How It Happens: The Process

#### 1. Training Phase
- Amortized methods start by training a model (e.g., a neural network) on a **large number of simulations**.
- The model learns a mapping from **observations** (data) to **posterior distributions**.

**Example:**
- Simulate data $\(x\)$ using a known set of parameters $\(\theta\)$ from your simulator.
- The model is trained to predict (P($\theta$ $\mid x$)\), the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data.

---

#### 2. Reuse Across Observations
- Once trained, the model can infer the posterior distribution for **new observations** without additional training.
- The model generalizes across similar datasets because it has learned the relationship between data $\(x\)$ and parameters ($\theta\$).

---

#### 3. Efficiency Gains
- Instead of retraining the posterior estimator for every new dataset or observation, you **reuse the same trained model**.
- This is much faster and computationally cheaper, especially when you have many observations to analyze.

---

### Why This Works

#### Generalization
- The model learns **general patterns** from the training data that apply to a wide range of possible observations.

#### Neural Networks (or Other Flexible Models)
- Neural networks are capable of approximating **complex mappings** from data to posteriors, allowing them to adapt to varying observations.

---

#### Advantages

1. **Speed**: Once trained, the model can infer posteriors for new observations almost instantaneously.
2. **Reusability**: The same model works for any observation within the same simulation context.
3. **Scalability**: Perfect for large-scale problems where multiple datasets or observations need to be analyzed.


## Sequential Methods in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

**Sequential methods** focus on improving efficiency by iteratively refining the posterior distribution based on new simulations. Unlike amortized methods, which estimate the posterior for all observations at once, sequential methods are tailored for **individual observations**. They carefully choose which simulations to run in order to extract the most information.

---

## How It Happens: The Process

### 1. Start with a Prior
- Begin with a **prior distribution** for the parameters (\(\theta\)), which represents your initial belief about the parameter values before observing any data.
- **Example:** You might start with a uniform prior over a wide range of possible parameter values.

### 2. Simulate Data
- Use your **simulator** to generate data \$(x\$) for different parameter values sampled from the prior.

### 3. Update the Posterior
- Based on how well the simulated data matches the observed data ($\(x_{\text{obs}}\$)), update the posterior distribution \(P(\theta \mid x_{\text{obs}})\).
- **Bayesian Updating:** The new posterior reflects which parameter values are more or less likely given the observed data.

### 4. Refine Parameter Search
- The algorithm identifies which parts of the parameter space are still uncertain or poorly explored.
- It focuses simulations in these regions to **improve the posterior estimate efficiently**.

### 5. Repeat the Process
- The prior is updated to the **refined posterior**, and new simulations are run in the most informative regions of the parameter space.
- This iterative process continues until:
  - The posterior distribution **converges**, or
  - The desired level of accuracy is achieved.

---

## Why It Works

Sequential methods work by focusing computational effort on the **most relevant simulations**, rather than wasting resources on regions of the parameter space that are already well-explored or unlikely to match the observed data.

---

## Key Features of Sequential Methods

### 1. **Efficiency**
- Fewer simulations are needed because the algorithm refines the posterior in areas of high uncertainty or importance.
- **Use Case:** Especially valuable for computationally expensive simulators, where running each simulation might take significant time or resources.

### 2. **Observation-Specific**
- Sequential methods are optimized for a **specific observation** (\(x_{\text{obs}}\)).
- Unlike amortized methods, they do not generalize to other observations. However, this specificity allows for **highly accurate posteriors** for individual cases.

### 3. **Adaptive Sampling**
- The method dynamically decides where to sample in the parameter space, prioritizing areas that will reduce uncertainty most effectively.

---

## Example for Intuition

Imagine you’re modeling disease spread based on two parameters:
- **Transmission rate (\(\theta_1\))**
- **Recovery rate (\(\theta_2\))**

Here’s how sequential methods work:

1. **Start with a Prior:**
   - Assume \(\theta_1 \sim U(0.1, 1.0)\) and \(\theta_2 \sim U(0.01, 0.5)\), representing uniform priors over a range of possible values.

2. **Simulate Data:**
   - Run the simulator for randomly sampled parameter values (\(\theta_1, \theta_2\)) and compare the simulated data to real observations of disease spread.

3. **Update the Posterior:**
   - Use Bayesian updating to refine the posterior, reflecting which parameter combinations are more likely.

4. **Refine Search:**
   - Focus the next round of simulations on regions of \((\theta_1, \theta_2)\) where the posterior is uncertain or poorly constrained.

5. **Repeat Until Convergence:**
   - Continue refining the posterior with each iteration, running simulations only in the most informative areas.

---

## Summary

**Sequential methods** are ideal for problems where:
- Running simulations is computationally expensive.
- You need accurate posterior estimates for a **specific observation**.
- Efficiency and targeted simulation are critical.

These methods dynamically focus effort where it matters most, refining the posterior iteratively and minimizing unnecessary computations.
